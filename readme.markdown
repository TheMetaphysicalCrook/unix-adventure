# unix-adventure

Become a unix wizard.

Unix is a mystical experience that permeates computing from the humble
lower-powered embedded device running busybox to the biggest server farms.

Unix was created in the
[1960s and 1970s at Bell Labs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tc4ROCJYbm0)
and remains hugely important in computing.

Many servers, phones, routers, embedded devices run an implementation of unix
such as MacOSX, Linux, Android, iOS, busybox, and FreeBSD.

# install

To play unix adventure, you will first need a unix.

If you are already running Linux or MacOSX, you are good to go!

If you are on Windows, consider dual-booting to a desktop Linux distribution
such as [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.com/). By dual-booting, you will be able to boot
your computer into linux or into windows and all your files will still be
available.

Another option is to install a virtual machine such as
[virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and then boot linux inside virtual
box.

If you are stuck, as some of your hacker friends for help getting set up with
linux!

Once you have a unix, from the command-line do:

```
npm install -g unix-adventure
```
